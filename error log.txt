    Welcome to "Guess my number" game!
    In this game I think of a number and you try to guess it.
    Then I will be guessing your number. We count attempts. The lesser - wins!
    Or we can switch it vice versa.

    Who would you like to be guessing first?

    Type "1" for: - You think, I guess!
    Type "2" for: - Try to guess what's on my mind!
    

2

Just "1" or "2", come on! That's not too difficult!	

Ok, let's set the high limit. We'll be guessing from 1 to what?	
2

            Please choose difficulty level:
            1 - for "dumbass" (uses no logic, just random guesses)
            2 - for "hither and thither" (knows how to do it, but sometimes forgets)
            3 - for "Dr. Nerd" (will guess your number in 1 tries)
            
1
Dumbass: Ready with your number? Press "enter" and I start guessing...
Attempt: 1
Dumbass: You think of the number 2? (type "y" or "n" for answer)
n
Dumbass: is your number higher or lower than 2? Type "+" if your number is higher or "-" if your number is lower
-
Attempt: 2
Dumbass: You think of the number 1? (type "y" or "n" for answer)
n
Dumbass: is your number higher or lower than 1? Type "+" if your number is higher or "-" if your number is lower

###################################################################################################
The error occurs since this particular case does not coinside with conditions causing error:

        if (start == end or (end - start == 1 and end != lmt) or
                            (end - start == 1 and answer == '-')):

Here we have:
I 	guess==2	start==0	end==2+1
	"-"		start==0	end=2
II	guess==1	start==0	end==2
	"+"		start=1	end==2

... since error conditions aren't hit it goes for another while iteration and tries to choose
 a random number between "1" and "1":

 		guess = randrange(start + 1, end)

WAYS TO FIX: 
1) Rework error conditions and split them to "+" and "-" cases
2) Make computer stop guessing if there is just one possible number left
